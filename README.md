- 👋 Hi, I’m Agnieszka
- 👀 I’m interested in e-commerce, project management & open source RoR projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently gathering knowledge to create a project that would power & encourage non-tech remote teams to support open source projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects, that need support with documentation or translations into polish language.
- 📫 How to reach me - just drop me an email to a.kappauf@kappeo.de
